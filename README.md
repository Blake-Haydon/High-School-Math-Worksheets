# High School Math Worksheets

This repo contains worksheets I created while working as a math tutor for high school students. All of the worksheets are fairly short and contain at most 4 questions. Hopefully they are useful and interesting :)

I still tutor math and science on the side. If you are interested in anything I've done I'd be happy to have a chat! Just shoot me an [email](mailto:blake@haydon.dev).
